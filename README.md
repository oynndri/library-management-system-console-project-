📚 Library Management System (Console-Based C Project)

A console-based Library Management System developed using C programming language. This project allows users to manage books and library members efficiently through a menu-driven interface with file handling and basic animations.

The system is designed for academic purposes and demonstrates the use of structures, file I/O, functions, loops, and conditional logic in C.

🚀 Features

📘 Add new books with author and title details
🔍 Search books by name
📄 Display complete book & member information
✍️ List all books by a specific author
📚 View titles of a selected book
📊 Check stock (Issued & Available books)
📤 Issue books to members
📥 Return issued books
👤 Add new library members
🎨 Colorful console UI with animated text
💾 Persistent data storage using text files

🛠️ Technology Used
Component	Technology
Programming Language	C
IDE	Code::Blocks
File Handling	Text Files (.txt)
OS Support	Linux / macOS / Windows (with minor changes)
📂 Files Used

librecord.txt → Stores all book records

membrrecord.txt → Stores member records

fp1.txt, fp2.txt → Temporary files for issue/return operations

📋 How to Run the Project
▶️ Using Code::Blocks

Open Code::Blocks

Create a new Console Application (C) project

Replace the default main.c code with the provided source code

Save the file (e.g., library.c)

Click Build & Run (F9)

Follow the on-screen menu options

📌 Concepts Covered

Structures (struct)

File handling (fopen, fscanf, fprintf)

Menu-driven programming

Conditional logic & loops

ANSI color codes

Basic text animation using usleep()

⚠️ Notes

Book names and author names should be entered without spaces

Text files must be in the same directory as the executable

system("cls") may need to be replaced with system("clear") for Linux/macOS

🎯 Project Objective

To build a simple yet functional Library Management System that demonstrates real-world application of C programming fundamentals and file-based data persistence.

💡 Future Enhancements

📌 Password-protected admin login
📌 Better search (by ID, author, keyword)
📌 Dynamic memory allocation
📌 GUI-based version
📌 Database integration
